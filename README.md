# oc-create-web-applications-with-spring-boot-activity

This repository contains my solution on the activity in the achieved OpenClassRoom course ["Create Web Applications Efficiently With the Spring Boot MVC Framework"](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/5684146-create-mvc-applications-with-springboot) .

The Activity can be found [here](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5684146-create-web-applications-efficiently-with-the-spring-boot-mvc-framework/6784216-get-some-practice-reorganizing-an-existing-codebase-using-three-tier-architecture-and-dependency-injection).

**Important:** Notice the [CsvBuilder](src/main/java/com/openclassrooms/course/springboot/activitych3/configuration/CsvBuilder.java) for reading a file in Classpath (in this case the CSV-File). Also notice the tests!!
